# Java_ArrayMethods

- The program contains a main method that declares and initializes several arrays of different types (int and double) and sizes, and then calls various methods implemented in the program to perform different operations on these arrays.

- The program then checks the return values of these methods against expected values and assigns a score to the score variable based on the number of tests passed. The program ends by printing the final value of the score variable.
